# watchdog

## what it is
watchdog is a fast and secure microkernel built in Rust. It is designed to be as fast and lightweight as possible, but many security
protocols are going on in the background ensuring that your data is safe.

watchdog can also be used as a hypervisor. Use make.py to specify that you want to build watchdog as a hypervisor. By default, watchdog
just builds the kernel and deletes the hypervisor code.

watchdog can also be hacked on to be both. I plan to use emacs once this is runnable and use emacs to control my hpervisor. :)
