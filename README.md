# watchdog

watchdog is a fast and secure microkernel built in Rust. It is designed to be as fast and lightweight as possible, but many security
protocols are going on in the background ensuring that your data is safe.

watchdog comes with nothing. Similar to Arch Linux, you pick what you want to be installed when you install watchdog.
